# finance_package

## Purpose
As a college student trying to learn more about computer science and finance, I'm trying to develop a package(framework) about the finance world's structure. This package will contain different classes that represent different financial entities (for example, investors, financial institutes, financial products). 

I treat coding this package as both practising cs skills (logic, data structure, algorithm) and strengthening my knowledge of finance. If you have any advice, you're very welcome to contact me at hjin36@emory.edu

## Privacy
I believe open source == opportunity to become better. You're very welcome to fork this repo and discuss any problems you meet. If you want to use this package for any purpose, it will be great if you include citation.
